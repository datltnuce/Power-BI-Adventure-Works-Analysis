# Power BI Adventure Works Analysis

**[Power BI] Adventure Works Analysis**

**I. Introduction**
The Production Department at AdventureWorks manages the manufacturing process, starting from receiving raw materials to producing and storing finished goods across multiple locations for distribution. Production timelines may not always match plans, and quality checks are conducted to remove defective items, ensuring only high-quality products are stored and sold. An **Operation Dashboard** will offer the Production Director a clear, visual overview of key metrics and processes, enabling more informed decision-making and streamlined operations.

| Who will be viewing this Dashboard?                                | Product manager<br> |
| If we had to choose only one key Stakeholder, who would it be?<br> | Product manager |
| What problem does this Dashboard solve?                            | Observe whetther production time is in accordance with the planned time<br>Minimize scrapped products.<br> |
| Describe the problem in one sentence                               | Manufacturing needs to track the quantity of scrapped products and the delivery time of products to ensure there are enough goods for distribution as well as to minimize the costs associated with scrapped products<br> |
| When and where will Stakeholders view this Dashboard?<br>          | Weekly, monthly<br> |
| Why do stakeholders need this Dashboard?<br><br>                   | Ensure that the company always has enough products to supply to customers<br>Improve the production process to minimize costs related to scrapped goods|
| How have stakeholders been achieving their goals so far?           | Improve the production process<br>Apply modern technology and machinery |

### Step 2 - Define POV

|                            | NORTHSTAR METRIC                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **What VALUE you want to measure?** | Delivery Success Rate                              |
| **WHEN the value DELIVERY SUCCESS?** |When orders are delivered on time, in full quantity, and meet quality standards. |
| **Northstar Metric Name**  | Delivery Success Rate                              |
| **WHY do you choose this metric?** | This is a composite indicator reflecting the overall efficiency of all three aspects: production (Completion Rate), inventory (Safety Stock Level Rate), and quality (Pass Rate). "Delivery Success Rate" measures the ability to deliver on time, in sufficient quantity, and with assured quality, which is the ultimate goal for all production and supply chain activities. |

Define Point of View
| View                     | Description                                                                                       | Why                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View 1         | To provide a high-level summary of production performance, order completion, and key metrics. | Allow senior management and stakeholders to quickly grasp an overall picture of operations, including total orders, on-time completion rate, and actual costs. It helps in making strategic decisions without delving into detailed data.    |
| View 2 | To analyze and monitor inventory levels, safety stock compliance, and product availability.     | Focus on ensuring inventory is maintained at a safe level, avoiding shortages or overstock situations. It supports supply chain and warehouse management teams in optimizing inventory to meet demand without causing waste. |
| View 3 | To evaluate production quality, defect rates, and reasons for scrapped products.    | Design for the quality management team to analyze issues related to defective products, pass rates, and root causes of scrapped items. It helps improve production processes and ensures product quality meets required standards. |
### Step 3 - Ideate
Brainstorming
